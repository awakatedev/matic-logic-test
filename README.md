# Matic logical test

This is the test of logic exercises for the vacancy as frontend developer for Matic.io company. 

In this repository you can validate the logic of the exercises and at the same time my skills as a React developer, the unit tests are made with Jest.

For the composition and validation of the unit tests I decided to create the components of the functions in separate folders, which contain 3 files, one in which is the function requested for the tests, the .test file for the unit validations and the jsx component for rendering in the graphical interface.
 
``` 
 components
├── FibonacciSequence
│   ├── FibonacciSequence.js
│   ├── FibonacciSequence.test.js
│   └── index.jsx
├── FizzBuzz
│   ├── FizzBuzz.js
│   ├── FizzBuzz.test.js
│   └── index.jsx
└── RepetitionsWords
    ├── RepetitionsWords.js
    ├── RepetitionsWords.test.js
    ├── index.jsx
```

`npm i` First command to run when cloning or intending to run the project to install the dependencies required by the project. &#x20;

`npm run lint` Run Eslint to correct syntax errors in the code.

`npm run test` For unit tests you can u

&#x20;`npm run build` Builds the app for production in the `build`.folder.
&#x20;Properly bundles React in production mode and optimises the build for best performance.

The design of the model was based on the styles and colors of the brand. Here is the link to the [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/M9wn1ZWGmM6b9J9xQ33bmP/Matic-logic-test-UI?node-id=0%3A1&t=P9xJCmqRipREOKJT-1) for you to appreciate.
